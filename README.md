# Python_work
Programmes developed with Python 
# This Repo will demonstrate how I have used Python to construct programmes to improve some of my daily routine work.
# The first file will be related  to   constructing an operation note using the textfile. The user will provide answers to questions which will be written to a textile.
# The second file will take this forward by creating a Word doc file in which user input will be transferred to a Word document. The programme structure will demonstrate import of Word docx and then the subsequent imports needed to create a successful word document
# Second it will showcase different programming methods to facilitate user input in creating an operation note - dictionaries, lists, for loops, if, elif and else statements. Input and print statements will be used as well as While loops
